# Book Interface
### This was a code challenge for a job interview from 2018.




Build your own persistent library in C++ or Java - 

1. Design and implement Book interface with name, id, author etc as members.
 
2. Design and implement an API for a persistent Library object with the following methods -
 
- addBook (Book)
- deleteBook (Book)
- printLibrary ()
- persist ()
 
3. The Library implementation needs to have its own data structure and CANNOT use constructs like Map, Collection, LinkedList, Set from the programming language
 
4. Write a main function that will do the following -
 
// Initialize library from file system
// Add 10 books in the Library
// Delete 5 books 
// Print contents of the Library
// Persist Library
 
Caution: The developer should not use any data structures available in the programming language.
 
Bonus points: Writing JUnit tests for Library interfaces.
